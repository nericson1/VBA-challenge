# VBA-challenge

## Description
Wrote macros to properly calculate the stocks with the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume in stock changes. Additional macros were written to display colors based on these factors.

## References
### ByVal vs ByRef
I looked up how to pass arguments into functions so I could reference values from other functions. Utilized both ByVal and by ByRef in lines 92, 107, 122, 149, and 176 of multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm.

### Variant Data Type
I looked up how to handle big numbers as the total stock volume values ended up being too large for the Long data type. Learned that defining a variable as the Variant data type will assign a subtype to the value that can handle the size. Utilized this information in lines 22, 71, 176, and 178 of multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm.

### FormatPercent
I looked up how to use code to format a range of cells as a percent. Utilized this information in lines 56 and 57 of multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm.

### Do Until Built in Function
I looked up how to use the existing VBA 'Do Until' function followed by defining the active cell as empty as another method of iterating through a column with an unknown number of rows. This is an alternative method to defining the lastrow value. Used this information to iterate through columns J, K, and L to set conditional formatting as well as write my functions that identified the greatest and smallest values in the columns. This information is found in lines 96, 111, 134, 161, and 188 of multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm.
